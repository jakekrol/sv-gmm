# SV GMM

## Samplot

Visualizing sample-wise alignment evidence for variants across different modes from GMM.

### Updates

#### 03/23/2025

- Plotted high coverage sample SVs
  - data: data/high_cov.tsv
  - plots: data/2025_03_22-highcov-samplots/samplots.zip

#### 11/6/2024

- Add more read context (1000x sv length from each breakpoint) and set samplot start and end to the breakpoints. 

#### 11/5/2024

- Sample BAMs were downloaded from 1000 genomes (phase 3, low coverage) aws s3 
- For a given variant, samples (individuals) were randomly selected from different modes and samplot'ed adjacently for comparison.
    - This was repeated 5 times for each variant.
